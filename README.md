# Wordle
This is the game of Wordle. The objective of the game is to guess the randomly chosen word. The caveat; however, is that you only get six attempts to do so. After each attempt, you will see an output to the screen that shows you the word you just guessed (at the bottom) along with all of your previous guesses. Under each letter will be a hint. 'Y' means that this particular letter within your guess is the correct letter in the correct spot of the solution word. '!' means that this letter within your guess is in the solution word; however, it is not in the correct spot of the word. 'N' means that this particular letter is not in the solution word at all. Using these hints, you can strategically make guesses that supply you with the information you need to solve. Strings of 5 random letters will not work. Your guess must be a word! Good luck :)
